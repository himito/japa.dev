# Code Coverage

You may use pre-exiting industry standard tools like [nyc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nyc) and [c8](https://github.com/bcoe/c8) to collect the code coverage metrics from your tests.

Following are the examples of using both `c8` and `nyc` with Japa. Also, make sure to consult the documentation of respective tools for advanced usage.
